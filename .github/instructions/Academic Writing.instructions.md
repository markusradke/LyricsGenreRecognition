# Paper Wrtiting Assistant Style Guideline 
Please help me to write academic texts or reformulate exisiting texts.

Please follow these guidelines when helping me with that. My main goal is to write clear and concise academic texts that are easy to read and understand. I follow principles and ideas laid out by Helen Sword in her book "Stylish Academic Writing". Please follow these guidelines when helping me with writing academic texts:

- Use as many concrete nouns and lively verbs as possible while staying concise.
- Try to always combine abstract nouns with lively verbs.
- Keep the distance between subject and verb as small as possible.
- Try to avoid to many ad-words (adjectives and adverbs that end with common suffixes such as able, ac, al, ant, ary, ful, ible, ic, ive, less, ly, ou)
- Try to avoid to many be-verbs (am, is, are, was, were, be, and been)
- Make sure the reference is clear when using pronouns
- Use technical terms (only) when necessary for effective communication and in a way that readers can understand.
- Use the active voice as much as possible.
- Lets people do things, not objects be things, where applicable.
- If applicable, use concrete spatial descriptions to help readers visualize concepts, where applicable.
- Try to always ground abstract ideas in concrete examples.
- Try to be as compact as possible without sacrificing clarity.
- Always use past-tense when describing methods (What has been done?)
- Use present-tense when describing results (What is the case?)
- When writing in English, please prefer American spellings and grammar.
- Please avoid em dashes and en dashes whenever possible.

#  TISMIR Style Guidelines
This is a TISMIR publication; please follow these guidlines: 
    Capitalisation

For the submission title:

Capitalise all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs and subordinate conjunctions (i.e. as, because, although). Use lowercase for all articles, coordinate conjunctions and prepositions.

    Slip-Sliding on a Yellow Brick Road: Stabilization Efforts in Afghanistan

Headings within the main text:

First level headings in the text should follow the same rule as the main title.

For lower-level subheadings, only capitalise first letter and proper nouns.

Headings should be under 75 characters.
Spelling

Submissions must be made in English. Authors are welcome to use American or British spellings as long as they are used consistently throughout the whole of the submission.

    Colour (UK) vs. Color (US)

When referring to proper nouns and normal institutional titles, the official, original spelling must be used.

    World Health Organization, not World Health Organisation

    Grammar

American or English grammar rules may be used as long as they are used consistently and match the spelling format (see above). For instance, you may use a serial comma or not.

    red, white, and blue OR red, white and blue

Font

The font used should be commonly available and in an easily readable size. This may be changed during the typesetting process.

Underlined text should be avoided whenever possible.

Bold or italicised text to emphasise a point are permitted, although should be restricted to minimal occurrences to maximise their efficiency.
Lists

Use bullet points to denote a list without hierarchy or order of value. If the list indicates a specific sequence then a numbered list must be used.

Lists should be used sparingly to maximise their impact.
Quotation marks

Use single quotation marks except for quotes within another speech, in which case double quotation marks are used.

Quotations that are longer than three lines in length must be in an indented paragraph separate from the main text.

The standard, non-italicised font must be used for all quotes.

It must be clear from the text and/or citation where the quote is sourced. If quoting from material that is under copyright then permission will need to be obtained from the copyright holder.
Acronyms & Abbreviations

With abbreviations, the crucial goal is to ensure that the reader – particularly one who may not be fully familiar with the topic or context being addressed – is able to follow along. Spell out almost all acronyms on first use, indicating the acronym in parentheses immediately thereafter. Use the acronym for all subsequent references.

    Research completed by the World Health Organization (WHO) shows …

A number of abbreviations are so common that they do not require the full text on the first instance. Examples of these can be found here.

Abbreviations should usually be in capital letters without full stops.

    USA, not U.S.A

Common examples from Latin origin do not follow this rule and should be lower case and can include full stops.

    e.g., i.e., etc.

Use of footnotes/endnotes

Use endnotes rather than footnotes (we refer to these as ‘Notes’ in the online publication). These will appear at the end of the main text, before ‘References’.

All notes should be used only where crucial clarifying information needs to be conveyed.

Avoid using notes for purposes of referencing, with in-text citations used instead. If in-text citations cannot be used, a source can be cited as part of a note.

Please insert the endnote marker after the end punctuation.
Hyphenation, em and en dashes

There is no set rule on the use of hyphenation between words, as long as they are consistently used.

Em dashes should be used sparingly. If they are present, they should denote emphasis, change of thought or interruption to the main sentence and can replace commas, parentheses, colons or semicolons.

    The president’s niece—daughter of his younger brother—caused a media scandal when…

En dashes can be used to replace ‘to’ when indicating a range. No space should surround the dash.

    10-25 years
    pp. 10-65

Numbers

For numbers zero to nine please spell the whole words. Please use figures for numbers 10 or higher.

We are happy for authors to use either words or figures to represent large whole figures (i.e. one million or 1,000,000) as long as the usage is consistent throughout the text.

If the sentence includes a series of numbers then figures must be used in each instance.

    Artefacts were found at depths of 5, 9, and 29 cm.
If the number appears as part of a dataset, in conjunction with a symbol or as part of a table then the figure must be used.

    This study confirmed that 5% of…

If a sentence starts with a number it must be spelt, or the sentence should be re-written so that it no longer starts with the number.

    Fifteen examples were found to exist…
    The result showed that 15 examples existed…

Do not use a comma for a decimal place.

    2.43 NOT 2,43

Numbers that are less than one must have ‘0’ precede the decimal point.

    0.24 NOT .24

Units of measurement

Symbols following a figure to denote a unit of measurement must be taken from the latest SI brochure.  If units are in a different system, then the SI units must be given along with the other units, e.g. 2.5 m (8 ft 2.4 in).
Formula

Formulae must be proofed carefully by the author. Editors will not edit formulae. If special software has been used to create formulae, the way it is laid out is the way they will appear in the publication.

Figures

Figures, including graphs and diagrams, must be professionally and clearly presented. If a figure is not easy to understand or does not appear to be of a suitable quality, the editor may ask to re-render or omit it.

All figures must be cited within the main text, in consecutive order using Arabic numerals (e.g. Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.).

Each figure must have an accompanying descriptive main title. This should clearly and concisely summarise the content and/or use of the figure image. A short additional figure legend is optional to offer a further description.

    Figure 1: 1685 map of London.
    Figure 1: 1685 map of London. Note the addition of St Paul’s Cathedral, absent from earlier maps.

Figure titles and legends should be placed within the text document, either after the paragraph of their first citation, or as a list after the references.

The source of the image should be included, along with any relevant copyright information and a statement of authorisation (if needed).

    Figure 1: Firemen try to free workers buried under piles of concrete and metal girders. Photo: Claude-Michel Masson. Reproduced with permission of the photographer.

If your figure file includes text then please present the font as Ariel, Helvetica, or Verdana. This will mean that it matches the typeset text.

Tables

Tables must be created using a word processor's table function, not tabbed text.

Tables should be included in the manuscript. The final layout will place the tables as close to their first citation as possible.

All tables must be cited within the main text, numbered with Arabic numerals in consecutive order (e.g. Table 1, Table 2, etc.).

Each table must have an accompanying descriptive title. This should clearly and concisely summarise the content and/or use of the table. A short additional table legend is optional to offer a further description of the table. The table title and legend should be placed underneath the table.

Tables should not include:

    Rotated text
    Colour to denote meaning (it will not display the same on all devices)
    Images
    Vertical or diagonal lines
    Multiple parts (e.g. ‘Table 1a’ and ‘Table 1b’). These should either be merged into one table, or separated into ‘Table 1’ and ‘Table 2’.
In-text citations 
Every use of information from other sources must be cited in the text so that it is clear that external material has been used. Please use parenthetical citations according to the 'Author: Year style'.

If the author is already mentioned in the main text then the year should follow the name within parenthesis.

    Both Jones (2013) and Brown (2010) showed that …

If the author name is not mentioned in the main text then the surname and year should be inserted, in parenthesis, after the relevant text. Multiple citations should be separated by semi-colon and follow alphabetical order.

    The statistics clearly show this to be untrue (Brown, 2010; Jones, 2013).

If three or fewer authors are cited from the same citation then all should be listed. If four or more authors are part of the citation then ‘et al.’ should follow the first author name.

    (Jones, Smith & Brown 2008)
    (Jones et al., 2008)

If citations are used from the same author and the same year, then a lowercase letter, starting from ‘a’, should be placed after the year.

    (Jones, 2013a; Jones, 2013b)

If specific pages are being cited then the page number should follow the year, after a colon.

    (Brown, 2004: 65; Jones, 2013: 143)

For publications authored and published by organisations, use the short form of the organisation’s name or its acronym in lieu of the full name.

    (ICRC 2000) NOT (International Committee of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 2000)

Please do not include URLs in parenthetical citations, but rather cite the author or page title and include all details, including the URL, in the reference list.

In-text tables, figures and equations
All tables, figures and equations used in the manuscript must be referenced somewhere within the text. Wherever they are referenced, please type out the name in full and add the number in which they appear. The number should not be placed within parentheses.

    Table 1; Table 2; Table 3 etc.
    Figure 1; Figure 2; Figure 3 etc.
    Equation 1; Equation 2; Equation 3 etc.

Reference list
If you are not using bibtex, please note the following details. All citations must be listed at the end of the text file, in alphabetical order of authors’ surnames. References should not be listed if they are not cited in the main text.

NOTE: If multiple works by the same author are being listed, please re-type the author’s name out for each entry, rather than using a long dash.
